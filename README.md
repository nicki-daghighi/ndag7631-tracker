## Introduction

BakeBook is a project aimed at helping baking enthusiasts keep track of their recipes. With BakeBook, you can easily add recipe details such as the recipe name and category, and the website will display the logged recipes for future reference.

## Features

- Add a recipe with a title and category
- Categorize recipes as Bread, Cookie, Cake, Pie, Pastry, or Other
- View and manage your logged recipes
- Delete recipes if needed

## Design

BakeBook's design has been simplified from the original plan due to limitations caused by a corrupted file and the lack of coding skills to implement complex design elements such as the rating system. Despite these limitations, the current design provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to log and manage recipes.

The design features a teal color scheme with a responsive layout, ensuring a pleasant experience across different devices and screen sizes. The design is minimalistic, focusing on essential elements such as recipe names, categories, and delete buttons. Each recipe category is represented by an appropriate category image for visual appeal.

## Usage

1. Open the BakeBook website in your web browser.
2. Use the "Add a Recipe" section to enter the recipe details, including the recipe name and category.
3. Click the "Log Recipe" button to add the recipe to your logged recipes.
4. The logged recipes will appear in the "Your Recipes" section, displaying the recipe name, category, and a delete button.
5. To delete a recipe, click the "Delete" button next to the respective recipe.
